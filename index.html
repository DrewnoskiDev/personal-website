      <p>
        Hello! I'm Keith Drewnoski, a Software Developer and Quality Assurance
        professional with a unique background in education.
      </p>

      <p>
        After nearly a decade as a behavioral special education teacher, I
        transitioned to software development, completing the Tech Academy Video
        Game Development Bootcamp. Since then, I've developed and delivered an
        MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for a production Angular-based web
        application, building core features from concept to deployment. This
        experience has given me hands-on practice in both software development
        and comprehensive QA testing.
      </p>

      <p>
        My background in education has equipped me with strong analytical
        thinking, attention to detail, and communication skills—all of which
        translate directly to writing clean code and ensuring software quality.
        I'm passionate about building reliable, user-friendly applications and
        ensuring they work flawlessly for end users.
