# LinkedIn Step-by-Step Update Guide

## STEP 1: HEADLINE ✅

### **Your Current Headline:**

"QA Engineer | Software Developer | Former Educator Transitioning to Tech | Open to Entry-Level Roles, Internships & Apprenticeships"

### **Review:**

**What's Good:**
✅ Leads with QA (your target)
✅ Mentions Software Developer
✅ Shows transition story
✅ Mentions internships & apprenticeships
✅ Professional and clear

**Potential Improvements:**

**Option 1: Keep As-Is (It's Good!)**
Your current headline is solid. No changes needed.

**Option 2: Balanced (RECOMMENDED - Based on Brother-in-Law's Advice)**
"Software Developer | QA Engineer | Former Educator | Open to Entry-Level Development & QA Roles, Internships & Apprenticeships"

**Changes:**

- Leads with "Software Developer" first (you built MVP)
- Then "QA Engineer" (you also tested it)
- "Entry-Level Development & QA Roles" (explicitly mentions both)

**Why:** Your brother-in-law is right - you have MVP development experience, so you should be applying for both. This positions you for both types of roles.

**Option 3: Development-First**
"Entry-Level Software Developer | QA Engineer | Former Educator | Open to Development, QA, Internships & Apprenticeships"

**Why:** Puts development first since you built and delivered MVP

---

## ✅ RECOMMENDATION (UPDATED)

**Your brother-in-law is right!** With MVP development experience, you should be applying for both software development AND QA roles.

**Use Option 2 (Balanced):**
"Software Developer | QA Engineer | Former Educator | Open to Entry-Level Development & QA Roles, Internships & Apprenticeships"

**Why:**

- ✅ Leads with Software Developer (you built MVP)
- ✅ Then QA Engineer (you also tested it)
- ✅ Positions you for BOTH types of roles
- ✅ More accurate to your experience
- ✅ Opens more opportunities

**OR Option 3 (Development-First):**
"Entry-Level Software Developer | QA Engineer | Former Educator | Open to Development, QA, Internships & Apprenticeships"

**Why:** Puts development first since that's significant experience

---

## 🎯 DECISION

**Choose one:**

- [ ] Keep current headline (it's good!)
- [ ] Use Option 2 (slightly optimized)
- [ ] Use Option 3 (explicit QA + Development)

**Once you decide, we'll move to Step 2: About Section**

## STEP 2: ABOUT SECTION ✅

### **Your Current About Section:**

"I am a Quality Assurance professional and aspiring Software Developer with a unique background in education—bringing analytical thinking, attention to detail, and strong communication skills to software testing and development.

My Journey

After nearly a decade as a behavioral special education teacher, I transitioned into tech through the Tech Academy Video Game Development Bootcamp. Since then, I've gained hands-on experience testing production-level Angular web applications, where I discovered a passion for quality assurance and user-focused software reliability.

What I Bring

QA & Testing: Functional, regression, and exploratory testing of Angular-based web apps, cross-browser checks, bug reporting, UX validation

Technical Skills: JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, HTML/CSS, Git/GitHub, Python, C#, SQL, Unity, Unreal Engine

Problem-Solving: 10 years of adapting to diverse learning needs translates into identifying edge cases and breaking down complex issues

Documentation: Skilled in writing clear, structured reports and detailed documentation (developed through IEPs and progress tracking)

Collaboration: Comfortable working with cross-functional teams and translating technical findings into actionable feedback

What I'm Seeking

I'm actively looking for QA Engineer, Software Tester, or Entry-Level Software Developer roles where I can build reliable, user-friendly applications. I'm especially interested in gaming, educational technology, and industries that value precision and user experience.

Open to part-time roles, full-time roles, internships, and apprenticeships.

I'm passionate about quality, problem-solving, and continuous learning.

### **Review:**

**What's Good:**
✅ Well-structured
✅ Shows QA and development
✅ Highlights transferable skills
✅ Mentions what you're seeking
✅ Professional tone

**What Needs Updating:**
❌ Doesn't mention MVP development
❌ Says "testing" but not "developing and delivering"
❌ Missing the "built and delivered" aspect Bill mentioned

### **Recommended Updates:**

**Update "My Journey" Section:**

**Current:**
"Since then, I've gained hands-on experience testing production-level Angular web applications, where I discovered a passion for quality assurance and user-focused software reliability."

**Updated:**
"Since then, I've developed and delivered an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for a production Angular-based web application, building core features from concept to deployment. This experience has given me hands-on practice in both software development and comprehensive QA testing, where I discovered a passion for quality assurance and user-focused software reliability."

**OR Shorter:**
"Since then, I've developed and delivered an MVP for a production Angular-based web application, gaining hands-on experience in both software development and comprehensive QA testing."

**Update "What I Bring" Section:**

**Current:**
"QA & Testing: Functional, regression, and exploratory testing of Angular-based web apps, cross-browser checks, bug reporting, UX validation"

**Updated:**
"Software Development & QA: Developed and delivered MVP for production Angular application | Functional, regression, and exploratory testing | Cross-browser compatibility testing | Bug identification and documentation | UX validation"

**OR Keep Separate:**

**Software Development:** Built and delivered MVP for production Angular application using Angular, TypeScript, and modern web technologies

**QA & Testing:** Functional, regression, and exploratory testing of Angular-based web apps, cross-browser checks, bug reporting, UX validation
